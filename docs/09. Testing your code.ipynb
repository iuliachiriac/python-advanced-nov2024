    "\n",
    "Testing your code is a very important step in the release cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it important?\n",
    "1. Until you execute a line of code, you don't know if that line can work at all.\n",
    "1. Until you execute your code with a representative set of basic use cases, you don't know if the code can work end-to-end.\n",
    "1. If you and possibly other people are going to modify your code, it's very easy to break it in unexpected ways. A suite of automated unit and integration tests gives you confidence you've not broken anything significant.\n",
    "1. Tests can be used for profiling, to help you understand changes in your system's performance, and raise a flag if something degrades significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For any software application, both unit testing, as well as integration testing, is very important as each of them employs a unique process to test a software application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit testing** means testing individual modules of an application in isolation (without any interaction with dependencies) to confirm that those pieces of code are doing things right. **Integration testing** means checking if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all kinds of tests besides integration and unit tests, and they're all important.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression tests, to make sure no bugs have recurred.\n",
    "* Performance tests against various workloads, to characterize and guide improvement of performance.\n",
    "* Stress tests to make sure the software can handle high loads, and work on a busy system.\n",
    "* Resource tests, both to ensure resource consumption isn't unreasonable, and to ensure the code works as expected under low resource conditions.\n",
    "* Change testing, for example when the IP address changes, the time is changed on the box, and so on."

    "## 1. Testing frameworks: `unittest`\n",
    "\n",
    "`unittest` is a Python Standard Librabry module which provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, `unittest` supports some important concepts in an object-oriented way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test fixture**\n",
    "A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate cleanup actions. This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test case**\n",
    "A test case is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test suite**\n",
    "A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test runner**\n",
    "A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of executing the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The building block of a test is the test case. With `unittest`, you can create a test case by subclassing the `unittest.TestCase` class. Each method starting with `test` will be an individual testing scenario. Test methods should contain at least one `assert*` method call as this is the essential role of a test: comparing actual results agaist expected results."

    "### Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pytest [...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script `pytest [...]` directly, except that calling via python will also add the current directory to `sys.path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running specific tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run tests in a module\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest test_mod.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run tests in a directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest testing/\n",

    "Run tests by keyword expressions\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest -k \"MyClass and not method\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will run tests which contain names that match the given string expression (case-insensitive), which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables. The example above will run `TestMyClass.test_something` but not `TestMyClass.test_method_simple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run tests by node ids\n",
    "\n",
    "Each collected test is assigned a unique nodeid which consist of the module filename followed by specifiers like class names, function names and parameters from parametrization, separated by :: characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a specific test within a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest test_mod.py::test_func\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another example specifying a test method in the command line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopping on failures\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop the testing process after the first (N) failures:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pytest -x           # stop after first failure\n",
    "pytest --maxfail=2  # stop after two failures\n",

    "\n",
    "`pytest` fixtures offer dramatic improvements over the classic xUnit style of setup/teardown functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fixtures have explicit names and are activated by declaring their use from test functions, modules, classes or whole projects.\n",
    "* fixtures are implemented in a modular manner, as each fixture name triggers a fixture function which can itself use other fixtures.\n",
    "* fixture management scales from simple unit to complex functional testing, allowing to parametrize fixtures and tests according to configuration and component options, or to re-use fixtures across function, class, module or whole test session scopes.\n",
    "* teardown logic can be easily, and safely managed, no matter how many fixtures are used, without the need to carefully handle errors by hand or micromanage the order that cleanup steps are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can tell pytest that a particular function is a fixture by decorating it with `@pytest.fixture`."
